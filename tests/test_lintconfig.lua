-- tests/test_lintconfig.lua — the "no blanket suppression" gate (lint.md, `M4-11`).
--
-- WHAT IT PROVES. That `luacheck .` reaching 0/0 in this repo is a statement about the code and not
-- about the configuration. Four things are checked, and all four are one rule seen from a different
-- side:
--   1. `.luacheckrc` sets no top-level `ignore`.
--   2. It switches no warning class off wholesale, which is `ignore` spelled as a switch.
--   3. Every `ignore` it does set sits in a `files[...]` stanza that is narrow — the key names one
--      `.lua` file, or the entry names the variable as well as the code (`212/self`).
--   4. Every inline `-- luacheck: ignore` in tracked Lua names a CODE. Bare, it silences every
--      warning in scope; with only a variable name after it, it silences every code for that name.
--
-- WHY IT EXISTS, in this repo specifically. `.luacheckrc` carried `ignore = { "212/self",
-- "212/event" }` through the whole 2026-09-07 remediation, and the exit pass found it. Both entries
-- named a variable, so this was a blanket in the mildest form the file has — and it still reached
-- all 56 files. Removing the two lines reported 101 findings, every one of them `212/self`, and not
-- one `212/event`: half the blanket had been silencing nothing at all. The 101 are answered by ten
-- per-file stanzas as of `M4c-06`, and the measurement that says the narrowing is real is in
-- `.luacheckrc` beside them — an unused `self` in a file with no stanza reports now and did not
-- before.
--
-- Rule 4 is this repo's own addition to the shape ConsumableMaster and WhatGroup landed, and it is
-- here because of what the exit pass found NEXT to the blanket. Nineteen files opened `local
-- addonName, NS = ...` over a folder name they never read, each with `-- luacheck: ignore
-- addonName` at the end of the line. That directive is narrow by the letter of rules 1 to 3 — it
-- names a variable — and it silenced a dead local in nineteen files for months. Naming the code
-- would not have saved them either; what saved them was `M4c-06` deleting the dead name. But a
-- directive that cannot say which warning it is answering is a directive nobody can review, and the
-- one this repo keeps says `212/filter` for exactly that reason (settings/OptionsSetup.lua:183).
--
-- Removing a blanket is one afternoon's work. Keeping it removed is what this file is for.
--
-- WHY IT READS THE CONFIG AS LUA RATHER THAN AS TEXT. `.luacheckrc` is a Lua chunk, and a text scan
-- for `ignore` is defeated by any of the half-dozen ways Lua has of writing the same assignment.
-- Loading it under a sandboxed environment gives back the same table luacheck itself builds, so
-- what this gate reads is what luacheck obeys. The environment auto-creates a table on first index
-- because `files["tests/"] = { ... }` is written without declaring `files` first, which is how
-- luacheck's own config loader behaves.
--
-- IT FAILS RATHER THAN PASSES WHEN IT CANNOT LOOK. No `.luacheckrc`, an unreadable one, a chunk
-- that will not compile or will not run, no `io.popen`, no git — every one of those is a failure,
-- not a skip. A gate that goes quiet when it is blind reports success, which is worse than not
-- existing. Same bargain tests/test_docs.lua and tests/_kit/test_eol.lua strike.
