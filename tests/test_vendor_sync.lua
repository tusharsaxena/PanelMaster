-- tests/test_vendor_sync.lua — the vendored-payload gate. Ported from prettychat,
-- which is where it was written and where it earned its keep.
--
-- WHAT IT CHECKS: that `libs/LibKa0s/` and `tests/_kit/` in this repo are exactly
-- what the LibKa0s repo published at the tag THIS README says it bundles.
--
-- WHY THE TAG AND NOT THE WORKING TREE: LibKa0s can be mid-release — several
-- commits and a pile of uncommitted work ahead of anything it has tagged.
-- Diffing against its working tree would redden this suite for upstream progress
-- this addon has not adopted and should not adopt, and the natural "fix" for that
-- red is to re-vendor uncommitted work, shipping bytes that exist at no ref
-- anybody can check out.
--
-- WHY IT EXISTS AT ALL: LibKa0s gave `testkit/` a revision (`Kit.VERSION`) and it
-- was vendored into six consumers — this one among them — straight off `master`,
-- while that revision was in no release. Every one of those repos then carried a
-- README provenance line naming a tag its `tests/_kit/` no longer matched, and
-- not one of them noticed, because prettychat was the only repo with this file.
-- It refused the vendor, correctly, and LibKa0s v1.4.0 was cut to make the
-- revision vendorable. This is that check, in this repo, so the next time it is
-- caught here too.
--
-- THE PROVENANCE LINE IS AN INPUT, NOT A CONSTANT. It is read out of README.md
-- rather than hardcoded: a provenance line and a vendored payload that disagree
-- is precisely the drift this file exists to catch, so the claim has to be the
-- thing under test. Bump the line and the bytes in the same commit.
--
-- ONE NORMALIZATION, AND ONLY ONE: `git show` hands back the stored blob, which
-- is LF, while the working tree is CRLF because `.gitattributes` pins
-- `* text=auto eol=crlf`. CR is stripped from the working-tree side so the file
-- is compared to the blob it round-trips to. Nothing else is normalized — a real
-- fork in content still fails.
