-- tests/test_docs.lua -- the one structural claim this repo makes about its own smoke document.
--
-- WHAT IT PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. That docs/smoke-tests.md still carries a section addressed
-- to a non-English client, that the section names the locale to run it on, and that it says what a
-- failure looks like rather than only what a pass does. It proves nothing whatever about that
-- section having been RUN -- a checklist is a checklist, and this repository has no client.
--
-- WHY THIS REPOSITORY IN PARTICULAR. This addon reads almost nothing the client translates, and
-- that is exactly why the gap was easy to miss: its locale exposure runs the other way, through
-- the panel NAMES a player types. Util.Slugify matches on [^%w]+ and Registry:FindByName folds
-- case with string.lower, and both of those are ASCII-only in Lua -- so on a German or French
-- client the frame name in this addon's PUBLIC contract can lose characters, and two different
-- names can slug to one global. Nothing headless can see it: every suite here feeds ASCII in.
--
-- The failure vocabulary is matched loosely on purpose: this file says "Fail" in some sections and
-- "Expect" in others, and pinning one spelling would redden the tree for a rewording.
