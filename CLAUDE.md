# CLAUDE.md — Ka0s Panel Master

**Ka0s WoW addon.** Adheres to the **Ka0s WoW Addon Standard** —
https://github.com/tusharsaxena/WowAddonStandards

## Standards compliance (read first)

This repo is built to the **Ka0s WoW Addon Standard**
(https://github.com/tusharsaxena/WowAddonStandards). All development here — features, refactors,
doc changes — MUST conform to it. The standard is the source of truth for layout, TOC shape, the
Ace substrate, schema-driven settings, slash/prefix conventions, locales, Compat, tests/lint, and
doc structure.

**If a change would deviate from the standard, STOP and flag the deviation explicitly.** Do not
silently deviate and do not silently "fix" to match. Surface it and let the user decide which of
two things it is:

1. **An accepted deviation** — this addon intentionally differs; record it as a documented
   deviation (e.g. in the TOC/README/`docs/` and in the audit bundle), with the reason.
2. **A change to the standard itself** — the standard's definition should evolve; the update
   belongs upstream in the WowAddonStandards repo, after which this addon conforms to the new rule.

When in doubt, treat standard conformance as a hard requirement and ask.

Start here, then read the docs:

- **`docs/agent-context.md`** — the full agent brief (stack, layout, hard rules, invariants,
  the `NS` bus, working environment, response style).
- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** — module map, settings schema, message bus, slash surface, event
  wiring, taint notes, known limitations.
- **`docs/testing.md`** — how to verify: the headless harness, lint, and the green commit gate.
- Topic detail in `docs/` as needed (`smoke-tests.md`, `test-cases.md`, …).

Green gate before every commit: `lua tests/run.lua` and `luacheck .` (0/0). Never auto-stage/commit/
push and never bump the version without an explicit instruction.
